# 🚀 CI/CD Project with Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub Webhook  

Hello everyone! 👋  
This is **Omar Ashraf** and welcome to my first complete **CI/CD Project**! 🎉  

---

## 🔧 What I did in this project
- 🖥️ Built a **CI/CD pipeline locally** using Bash scripting.  
- 🐳 **Dockerized** the application.  
- ⚙️ Ran the app and its dependencies using **Docker Compose**.  
- ✅ Automated **code linting** and **testing**.  
- 🔗 Integrated **Jenkins with GitHub** using **webhooks** → so with every push, the pipeline runs automatically!

## 🙌 My Journey
I’m really happy to share this with you!  
When I started my **DevOps internship**, I had no background except for **Cloud** ☁️.  
Today, I was able to build a **full CI/CD pipeline from zero**!  

I hope everything is clear.  
I’ve also prepared detailed **documentation** with screenshots, challenges I faced, and how I solved them.

✨ Thanks for reading & happy coding!
