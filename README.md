# 🚀 CI/CD Project — Team Availability App

**Hello all!**
Welcome to my **CI/CD project** 👋

This project demonstrates how to build and run a complete **CI/CD pipeline** for a real-world application: the **Team Availability App**.
The goal is to automate the application lifecycle — from code quality checks, to building and containerizing, all the way to running it locally and deploying it on the cloud.

---

## 🔧 What this project covers

* **Code Quality**: Linting & testing automation.
* **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose for local environment setup.
* **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build and deploy using Jenkins & GitHub integration.
* **Webhook Trigger**: Configured Jenkins to automatically start the pipeline on each GitHub push.
* **Cloud Deployment**: Deployed on **Google Cloud Run** with a managed **Postgres (Cloud SQL)** backend.
